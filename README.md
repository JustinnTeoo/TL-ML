# Classification of Osteoarthritis Severity Grading using Transfer Learning and Machine Learning

Application of transfer learning models such as InceptionV3, Xception and DenseNet201 for feature extraction of a rebalanced 1,000 knee X-ray images taken from Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI)  dataset  with  5  classes  graded  0â€“4  according  to  Kellgren-Lawrence  grading  split  into a 70/15/15 training/validation/testing split. The features extracted are subsequently fed into machine learning classifiers, namely support vector machine (SVM), random  forests  (RF)  and  logistic  regression  (LR). An average multiclass    accuracy    of    71.33%    was    achieved    for    hyperparameter    fine-tuned DenseNet201-SVM model.
